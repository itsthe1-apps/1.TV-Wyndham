var fakeNewsList='[{"id":"3","title":"Lee Dixon\'s tactical view ","summary":"Brazil were one of the World Cups pre-tournament favourites but after their shock 2-1 defeat by the Netherlands in their quarter-final on Friday, they only have themselves to blame.","fullnews":"We have seen a lot of poor defending in South Africa so far but, until the start of the second-half against the Dutch, the Brazilians probably had one of the most reliable back-fours in the competition. So it was surprise to see them undone by such schoolboy errors. Both the goals they conceded were not because of good play, any piece of fine skill, or even being out-thought tactically. All they faced was some quick thinking by the Dutch, and it only worked because Brazil showed such poor concentration. I cannot really explain why top-class defenders would defend in the way they did, and it really should not happen in a World Cup quarter-final. ","date_added":"1285332604000"},{"id":"4","title":"Team talk inspired us - Sneijder ","summary":"Dutch match-winner Wesley Sneijder said a rousing half-time team talk inspired the Netherlands to knock out Brazil at the last-eight stage of the World Cup.","fullnews":"The Dutch came from behind to beat 10-man Brazil 2-1 as a Felipe Melo own goal cancelled out Robinhos opener, before Sneijder headed in the winner. In the changing room at half-time, everyone said to each other lets give everything, said Sneijder. We pressured their defence and to score twice was fantastic. Sneijders header from a corner gave the Netherlands the lead on 68 minutes, but matters were made easier for them five minutes later when Melo received a red card for stamping on winger Arjen Robben.","date_added":"1285332775000"},{"id":"5","title":"Team tracker and Predictor ","summary":"Welcome to our interactive wallchart which weve created to enhance our coverage of this summers World Cup.

","fullnews":"Ghana seemed certain to become the first African side to reach the last four of the competition when Luis Suarez saw red after handling on the line in the dying seconds of extra-time.However, striker Asamoah Gyan, who had already converted two penalties in South Africa, skimmed the crossbar with the last kick of the game.Gyan showed incredible guts to take the first spot-kick of the shoot-out but John Mensah and Dominic Adiyiah both had their low strikes saved by Fernando Muslera.And Sebsatian Abreu then showed ice-cold composure to dink the decisive penalty beyond Richard Kingson as Uruguay sealed a semi-final tie against the Netherlands.Suarezs deliberate handball, which came seconds after he had legitimately blocked one goal-bound effort with his knee, was a gamble that paid handsome dividends.It was a truly remarkable final few minutes, surely some of the most dramatic in World Cup history, and came at the end of an engrossing and occasionally bad-tempered contest.Both teams enjoyed periods in the ascendancy - and both were guilty of wasting numerous opportunities.","date_added":"1285332795000"},{"id":"7","title":"Germany tore Argentina apart ","summary":"Germany tore Argentina apart to book their place in the semi-finals and, for now at least, end Diego Maradonas dream of winning the World Cup as coach to go with his victory as captain in 1986. ","fullnews":"Inspired by Bastian Schweinsteiger and two-goal hero Miroslav Klose, Joachim Loews side scored four times for the third game at this tournament in what was a devastating attacking display.Klose found the net only three times in the Bundesliga all season in a miserable campaign for Bayern Munich but he has now beaten that tally at this tournament, as well as moving to within a goal of Ronaldo, who with 15 goals, is the all-time highest scorer at World Cup finals.After Thomas Muellers early header, Germany coped with everything Argentina could throw at them before finishing off Maradonas men with a lethal late burst.Following Brazils self-destruction against the Dutch on Friday, Germany became the latest European team to see off a highly fancied South American side, and they move into the last four looking in good shape to become world champions for the first time since 1990.","date_added":"1285332805000"}]';var fakeChannelList='[{"id":"53","name":"MBC
